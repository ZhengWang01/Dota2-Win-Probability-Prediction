# Motivation for This Project

E-sports is a rapidly growing field and draws a lot of public attention this year. Dota2 has a subscription service called DotaPlus, including a feature that shows a real time win probability graph, but its algorithm is not revealed. I would like to build a model that train from the replay files to do the similar task: given the time and game information, predict the win probability of both teams.
